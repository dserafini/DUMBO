This is the code I developed during my Master's thesis journey to run GEANT4 simulations that evaluate the performance of a MAPS-based beta radiation detector. Order is definitely not a strength of this project and my coding style is probably extremely naive. I beg pardon to everyone that ends up here, but sharing will help progress the work I started during my thesis.  

Inside these folders you can find:

- ALPIDEmeasurments: all the instructions and scripts I used to carry out the first ALPIDE measurments with laboratory sources. The data I collected during the experiments are ALL contained in the 'data' folder;

- BETA DETECTOR: contains ALL the Geant4 simulation, i.e. the 2D in-vitro scenario one, the 3D in-vitro scenario one and the simulation that models the experimental set-up used in the preliminary ALPIDE test;

- DataTakingALPIDE: is a mess. It contains many data I collected during the first raw trails with the ALPIDE that I did not use for the thesis and again the scripts to make the ALPIDE work with the FPGA;

- Schemi: as you may guess, contains some scheamtic illustrations that I used for my thesis. Not too interesting for anyone else I guess.
