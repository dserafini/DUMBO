BETA DETECTOR SIMULATION

These folders contain all the simulation and analysis files developed to test the future experimental scenario in ISOLPHARM in-vitro experiments using Monte Carlo simulations with GEANT4. The goal is to replicate the response of the beta detector that will be constructed using MAPS ALPIDE when used to study the distribution of the prototype radiopharmaceutical in two- and three-dimensional cell cultures. The detector aims to generate activity maps that reveal where the drug has been internalized through the detection of beta radiation.
To replicate the in-vitro scenarios that will be met, the simulations are divided based on the biological source analyzed. The model of the detector employed in each simulation is the same, but the radiation source is varied based on the necessities.

- 'petri_g4_isolpharm_alpide' contains the simulation that models a two-dimensional traditional cell culture;

- 'g4_isolpharm_alpide' contains the simulation that models a three-dimensional hydrogel-based cell culture;

- 'testALPIDE_g4' contains the simulation that models the experimental scenario used in the first preliminary tests with the ALPIDE chip including sealed laboratory radiation sources.
